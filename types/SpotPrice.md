## Dispute Considerations

Reporters should use care in selecting data sources and choosing the algorithm to combine them.

- Multiple sources should be used whenever possible.
- When retrieving data directly from exchanges, feed users might expect that exchanges with lower volumes
have their prices weighted accordingly to avoid erratic results.
- Care should also be used when retrieving data from aggregators.  
- It is the reporters responsibility to ensure that the feed result is *reasonable* enough for a community consensus, otherwise it may be subject to dispute.
- If a *reasonable* value cannot be determined, a value should not be submitted
